NichePy version 1.1

GET NICHEPY

To download NichePy select the tab "Downloads" and choose one
of the archive options (zip or tar.gz) to download the NichePy
scripts and example files.

Alternatively:

$ git clone https://github.com/bastodian/NichePy.git

This will download the contents of the NichePy repository into
a folder called NichePy.

Prerequisite for this to work is that you install git if you 
haven't already installed it on your machine 
(http://git-scm.com/download).

INSTALLATION

Refer to the MANUAL for additional details. In short, all
Python scripts require Python version 3 (ideally >= 3.2).

The functions required by NichePy scripts are contained in the 
nichefunc.py module. In addition Python versions 3 < 3.2 require 
the argparse.py module to work. Simply keep these module files
in the same directory as the resampling scripts, nicheIdentity.py
and nicheBackground.py, and the getMetric.py script.

Included is an installation script that places a link from the
location of the getMetric, nicheIdentity, and nicheBackground 
scripts to the folder /usr/bin and makes the scripts executable.
In addition, the nichefunc and/or argparse modules will be installed
using Python's built-in installer.

After running the installation script the scripts can be called from
anywhere in the file hierarchy.

To install using our installation script:

$ python3 setup.py install

EXAMPLES

The folder Examples contains example occurrence data sets and models.
Please refer to the README in the Exmple folder to learn more about 
the input/output datastructure for NichePy.
