A/ REQUIREMENTS

    All scripts provided in NichePy should function on any operating system that
has the Python Programming Language version 3 or higher installed. Please
refer to www.python.org/getit/ to download and install Python on your operating 
system. We recommend installing Python >= version 3.2. Python < version 3.2 
should work as well, but see the end of this section.
     
    MACOS: Current versions of MacOSX come with Python2 pre-installed, but at 
this point lack Python3 in the default installation. You can download Python3
for MacOS from www.python.org/getit/.
    
    LINUX/BSD/UNIX: Either use your package manager to download the latest
Python3 package or build Python 3 from source (www.python.org/getit/).
    
     WINDOWS: Windows installers for Python can be downloaded at 
www.python.org/getit/. Detailed instructions on how to set up Python on 
Windows can be found here: http://docs.python.org/using/windows.html. 
Note: to be able to run analyses in batches as part of pipelines (see G & H 
below) you may want to make yourself familiar with Cygwin (www.cygwin.com) 
which provides a Linux-like environment for Windows. In this case install Python 
in the Cygwin environment (see http://docs.python.org/using/windows.html).

    If you are working with WINDOWS you will have to replace / with \ where 
applicable unless you use Cygwin!
    
    Our code is not compatible with Python ver. 2.x. If you are running Python 
ver. < 3.2 you will have to set up the argparse module (argparse.py) that we are 
distributing with the scripts. 

    The setup script setup.py should take care of the installation of argparse
in case you need it. With root privileges run:

$ python3 setup.py install

If you don't run the setup script just leave the modules argparse.py and
nichefunc.py in the directory that contains the remainder of the Python scripts.
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B/ WORKFLOW

    NichePy contains 3 Python scripts as of now: nicheIdentity.py, 
nicheBackground.py, and getMetric.py. 

    General workflow:
species occurrence data -> nicheIdentity.py -> ENM/SDM -> getMetric.py
species occurrence data -> nicheBackground.py -> ENM/SDM -> getMetric.py
    
    nicheIdentity.py resamples species occurrence data as outlined in Warren 
et al.'s (2008) test of niche identity. Assume you have occurrence point nA 
and nB for two species A and B. The script pools nA and nB. After pooling 
pseudo-replicate datasets of sizes nA and nB are generated from the pooled 
dataset nA+nB. With both original and pseudoreplicate datasets ENMs/SDMs can 
be build.

    nicheBackground.py resamples species occurrence data as outlined in Warren
et al.'s (2008) test of niche background. If A and B are species let oA and oB
denote the cells in which each species is known to occur in study areas NA and
NB. The script resamples oA cells from NA and oB cells from NB. Both NA and NB
have to be ASCII grid files that need to be supplied by the user. For eaxmple,
NA and NB could be euclidian distance buffers around oA and oB, which can easily 
be generated in ESRI's ArcMap or ArcView. Using the pseudo-replicate datasets 
ENMS/SDMs can be built.

    ENM/SDM are left to the user. I.e., the user of NichePy decides how ENMs/
SDMs will be generated from pseudo-replicate datasets. Several software packages
are available for this purpose. Among these, openModeller*1 is particularly 
interesting, as openModeller allows running multiple different ENM/SDM 
algorithms. Similarly Maxent*2  lends itself to analyzing a lot of data in batch 
mode (refer to the examples in BashScripts). Please conatact us if you need help
or advice for a particular analysis.

    getMetric.py calculates the niche overlap metrics (I, D, and BC). For the 
niche identity test overlap metrics are cacluated by comparing the ENMs/SDMs for
the original occurrence datasets to one another. Then all pair-wise comaprisons
between the resampled datasets are performed. For the background test, niche
overalp metrics are calculated by comparing the ENMs/SDMs for the original 
occurrence datasets to one another. Pseudo-replicate ENMs/SDMs generated from
the background of species B (NB) are compared to the ENM/SDM of species A using 
the niche overlap metrics. Then, ENMs/SDMs generated from NA are compared to the
ENM/SDM from species B.
    P-values for both tests are calculated for all metrics and tests by counting
the number of pseudo-replicate overlap values that are bigger or smaller than
the value observed from ENMs/SDMs generated from original occurrence datasets.
This allows testing different null-hupotheses; e.g., 1) Are the ENMs/SDMs of 
species A and B more different than expected by chance, and 2) Are the ENMs/SDMs
of species A and B more similar than expected by chance?

*1 http://openmodeller.sourceforge.net/ -- Note that the Dektop version of 
openModeller can be a bit iffy when dealing with hundreds of occurrence datsets, 
as is the case when performing the tests implemented in NichePy. Here the 
command line verion of openModeller is much more reliable, but you will have to 
compile it from source (see http://openmodeller.sourceforge.net/INSTALL.html).

C/ INPUT-OUTPUT DATA

    Below is a summary of the input and output data for NichePy. The Example 
folder contains files that were formatted to work with NichePy. Follow the 
occurrence data naming scheme in the example files and place the models you want
to use getMetric on in a folder structure similar to the one provided in the
examples.

    nicheIdentity requires two comma-delimited csv files containing species ID,
longitude, and latitude. Resampling of occurrence data for the identity test 
occurrs from these input files. The output of this script is a comma-delimited
csv file that contains both the original and the resampled occurrence datasets.
Resampled datasets are numbered from 0 to n (where n is the number of 
pseudo-replicates).
    
    nicheBackground also requires two comma-delimited csv files containing 
species ID, longitude, and latitude. In addition, two ARC/INFO ASCII grids are 
required that describe the background from which occurrence points are 
resampled. The output of this script is a comma-delimited csv file that contains 
both the original and the resampled occurrence datasets. Resampled datasets are 
numbered from 0 to n (where n is the number of pseudo-replicates).
    
    getMetric requires a folder that contains folders with the original and 
pseudo-replicate ARC/INFO ASCII grids that represent niche or distribution 
models. E.g., a folder /output containing the sub-folders /algorithmA and 
/algorithmB which contain original and pseudo-replicate models derived from two 
different algorithms. The ARC/INFO ASCII files contained in these folders should 
be named in the following way: Genus_SpeciesA.asc and Genus_SpeciesB.asc whereas 
pseud-replicates should be named Genus_speciesA_0.asc to Genus_speciesA_n.asc and 
Genus_speciesB_0 to Genus_speciesB_n.asc. If models were generated using the csv 
files generated by nicheIdentity and nicheBackground files should already be named 
appropriately.
    getMetric will loop over the sub-folders and calculate metrics for Arc/INFO 
ASCII grids contained in the sub-folders. getMetric will fail if you try to run 
it on a folder that does not contain one or several sub-folders. So if you only 
have a single algorithm/experiment you still need to create a folder containing 
a sub-folder in which the ARC/INFO ASCII grids are contained (e.g., 
/output/algorithm).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D/ nicheIDENTITY.PY

    Two comma-delimited csv files with species occurence data are required as 
input (Species,Longitude,Latitude) where Longitude and Latitude should to be in 
decimal degrees.

    The script can be called from the command line as follows:

    will be generated. Default is 100.
    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
E/ nicheBACKGROUND.PY

    Two comma-delimited csv files with species occurence data are required as 
input (Species,Longitude,Latitude) where Longitude and Latitude should to be in 
decimal degrees. In addition, two ASCII grids need to be provided from which
pseudo-replicate occurrence points will be drawn. It is up to the user to decide
how these ASCII grids will be generated.

    The script can be called from the command line as follows: 
$ python3 /path/to/file/nicheBackground.py

    for species B. Use absolute paths to ensure the script can find the file.
    E.g., /path/to/file/GridB.asc
-n or --numreps
    Optional flag that specifies the number of pseudo-replicate datasets that 
    will be generated. Default is 100.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
F/ getMETRIC.PY

    This script calculates the coorected modified Hellinger distance, I (Roedder 
& Engler 2011; Bentlage & Shcheglovitova in prep), and Schoener's D (Warren et 
al. 2008; Roedder & Engler 2011; Bentlage & Shcheglovitova in prep) from ENMs/
SDMs. 
    ASCII grid files from pseudo-replicates should be named somename_number.asc
(e.g., speciesA_0.asc, speciesB_0.asc, speciesA_1.asc, speciesB_1.asc,...). It
is only important that the last part of the filename contains a number prefaced 
by an underscore. ENMs/SDMs derived from the original occurrence datasets (i.e.,
not the pseudo-replicates) should not contain an underscore followed by a 
number. If pseudo-replicates were generated using nicheIdentity.py and/or 
nicheBackground.py should conform to this standard.
    ASCII grid files named as described above need to be in a folder that 
contains a subfolder for each ENM/SDM algorithm. E.g., the folder /getMetric
should contain folders /getMetric/algorithmA, getMetric/algorithmB,...
    getMetric.py will iterate over the folder that contains subfolders with 
ASCII grids and calculate I or D for the appropriate pairs of ASCII grids. The
pairing of ASCII grids to be compared depends on the test, identity or 
background.

    The script can be called from the command line as follows: 
$ python3 /path/to/file/nicheMetric.py
    Depending on the operating system the following may execute Python ver. 3:
$ python /path/to/file/nicheMetric.py


*Options

-h or --help
    Displays help in the terminal.
-i or --indir
    Required flag that specifies the input directory that contains subfolders 
    each of which contains ASCII grid files from ENM/SDM that shall be compared
    using I, D, and/or BC.
-t or --test
    Required flag. 
    -t identity calculates I, D, and/or BC for the niche identity test outlined 
    in B above. Niche models should have been generated from pseudo-replicates 
    generated by nicheIdentity.py. 
    -t background calculates I or D for the niche background test outlined in 
    B above. Niche models should have been generated from pseudo-replicates 
    generated by nicheBackground.py.
-s or --statistic
    Required flag.
    -s more calculates P by counting the number of pseudo-replicate niche 
    overlap values (I, D, and/or BC) that are smaller than I, D, and/or BC 
    observed from the original occurrence datsets. This test thus tests the
    hypothesis "Are the ENMs/SDMs for species A and B more similar than the 
    pseudo-replicates?"
    -s less calculates P by counting the number of pseudo-replicate niche 
    overlap values (I, D, and/or BC) that are larger than I, D, and/or BC 
    observed from the original occurrence datsets. This test thus tests the
    hypothesis "Are the ENMs/SDMs for species A and B less similar than the 
    pseudo-replicates?"
-n or --numreps
    Optional flag that specifies the number of pseudo-replicate datasets that 
    will be generated. Default is 100.
    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
G/ RUNNING LONG ANALYSES

    Both nicheIdentity.py and nicheBackground.py run quite fast and generally 
finish within minutes. Calculating I, D, or BC for large datsets and many 
replicates, however, may take hours or days. You may not want to stay logged in
to your shell that long. In order to be able to log out from a shell/terminal 
session and secure your analysis we have two suggestions. 1) Run the analysis in 
the background and 2) log the messages that are dumped onto the screen in a 
logfile. ($ below represents the shell prompt)

    Running the analysis in the background is easily accomplished on Unix-like
systems (including Cygwin). To run a program in the background simply add an 
ampersand to the end of the command. For example:

$ python3 ./getMetric.py -i /some/path/ -s more -t identity &

    Here the script runs in the background and will not terminate even when the
shell is closed. It can be stopped using the kill command though.

    Log the messages the script dumps onto the screen and run the script in the 
background. For this purpose output redirection is useful. For example:

$ python3 ./getMetric.py -i /some/path/ -s more -t identity > log.txt 2>&1 &

    The above command redirects error messages and other messages into a file 
called log.txt while the program runs silently in the background.

    Run a script and delete messages that appear on the screen immediately:
    
$ python3 ./getMetric.py -i /some/path/ -s more -t identity > /dev/null 2>&1 &

    In the above example the script runs in the background and all messages 
generated by it are discarded in the bin (/dev/null).

    More information on these topics can be found on the internet by searching
for input/output redirection in the shell.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
H/ PIPELINES

    NichePy is well-suited to be run as part of analysis pipelines. We designed 
NichePy as a set of independent Python scripts with the idea that they may be
part of an analysis chain. Below we outline the general idea of such a chain. 
If you have suggestions or questions please do not hesitate to contact us!

    An example chain of commands:
    
$ python3 ./nicheIdentity.py -d /some/outdir -o outfilename.csv 
    -A myFileA.csv -B myFileB.csv && ENM/SDM && python3 ./getMetric.py 
    -i /some/dir/with/ENMsOrSDMs/ -t identity && execute some r.script &
    
    The above is not a true pipeline in the sense that standard in/standard out 
are piped straight from one program to the next. Instead multiple programs and
scripts are chained together using &&. Here the first program or script finishes
and if it successfully exits the next program is executed using the files that 
the previous program/script created as input. This process continues until the
end of pipeline is reached.
    In the example NichePy scripts are incorporated into an automated analysis 
by creating the input files for some ENM/SDM algorithm/program which generates 
ENMs/SDMs from pseudo-replicate and original occurrence datasets. ENMs/SDMs
generated can then serve as the input for getMetric.py which generates I, D, 
and/or BC values. These in turn can be read into some r script and automatically
analyzed in some custom way. The entire analysis runs in the background without
any user input. Adding log-files into this chain would allow evaluating each 
step after the analysis finishes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I/ RUNNING ANALYSES IN PARALLEL

    At present NichePy is not written to take advantage of multiple processors. 
Both nicheIdentity and nicheBackground run reasonably fast, but running 
getMetric on several large datasets sequentially can take a long time. If you 
have output from multiple experiments or modeling algorithms you can parallelize 
getMetric by using GNU Parallel. Download it and follow the installation 
instructions: http://www.gnu.org/s/parallel/
    Remember that getMetric requires your results to be in a sub-folder or it 
will exit with an error (see section C). For parallelization of getMetric you 
need to create one more layer or folders to run getMetric (e.g., 
/ouput/modelA/modelA and /output/modelB/modelB instead of /output/modelA and 
/output/modelB ).
    Further, you need to set up a batch file that contains the commands you want 
to run. E.g., a text file batch.txt containg the following:

python3 ./getMetric.py -i /output/modelA/ -s more -t identity
python3 ./getMetric.py -i /output/modelB/ -s more -t identity

    You can run the commands contained in the text file in parallel using GNU
Parallel as follows:

$ parallel -j+0 < batch.txt

    In this simple example the contents of batch.txt are passed to GNU Parallel 
which handles the parallelization of the commands contained in batch.txt. In the 
example here two instances of getMetric will run in parallel, one working on 
modelA and the other one evaluating modelB. The flag -j+0 tells GNU Parallel not
to start more threads than there are cores on the machine. If you include more
instances of getMetric in the batch file than there are physcial cores on the 
machine GNU Parallel will start more threads than there are physical cores, 
unless you pass the flag -j+0 to GNU Parallel.

Running your analyses in this way can cut run times significantly!
